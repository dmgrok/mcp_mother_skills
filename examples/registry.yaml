# Example: Skills Registry Index
# 
# NOTE: This is an EXAMPLE file showing the registry format.
# For production use, Mother MCP consumes from the agent_skills_directory:
# 
# Skills:  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dmgrok/agent_skills_directory@main/catalog.json
# Bundles: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dmgrok/agent_skills_directory@main/bundles.json
#
# Mother MCP is a CONSUMER of this data, not the source.
# Quality signals (downloads, stars, verified) come FROM the registry.

# The agent_skills_directory catalog is the canonical source for:
# - Skills metadata from providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub, Vercel, HuggingFace, etc.)
# - Curated bundles (collections of skills by use case)
# - Quality signals (stars, downloads, verification status)

# Skills are fetched from catalog.json
# Bundles are fetched from bundles.json (contributed separately)
